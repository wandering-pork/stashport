# 🌍 Stashport — MVP Scope & Product Priorities

**Version:** MVP Definition
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## 🎯 Product North Star

**Stashport exists to help users:**

> *Plan a trip, feel proud of it, and easily share it as inspiration or social content.*

Any feature included in MVP must clearly support at least one of the following:
- Faster or easier trip creation
- Making trips feel publishable and complete
- Encouraging sharing, reuse, or inspiration

If a feature does **not** support one of these outcomes, it is **not MVP**.
